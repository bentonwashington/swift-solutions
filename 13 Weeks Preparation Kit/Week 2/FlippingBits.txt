func flippingBits(n: Int) -> Int {
    // Write your code here
    
    //Really was not sure what I was doing on this one but figured it out with a little research
    //my understanding is that we are trying to flip the bits
    
    //here I convert the given int to a 32bit value type
    let initialBits = UInt32(n)
    
    //here I flip the bits
    let invertedBits = ~initialBits
    
    //since I have to return an Int, I convert the invertedBits back to an Int
    return Int(invertedBits)
}

Thank you Jesus!!
